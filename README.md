Making minecraft modpacks and sharing them with friends is easy now.

# Important Info
Download MUST be a direct download link. Not a link to a download page. Direct to file.

On CurseForge, click download, then right click and copy link address for the try again text.

On Modrinth, right clicking the main download button is direct.

# Features
- Easy creation and sharing of modpack configs.
- One click installation of modpack configs
- Generate mod list from existing mods folder, saving SOME time. Note this isn't a one click and done; it will still need download links filled and versions changed to match game version.
