# Features
- Easy creation and sharing of modpack configs.
- One click installation of modpack configs
- Generate mod list from existing mods folder, saving SOME time. Note this isn't a one click and done; it will still need versions changed to match game version if they were not found, or a mod version was filled in incorrectly.
- Pasting A download link **when version and name are not filled in** will try to autofill via obtaining it from the URL pasted. Version will assume the entry above's version if present, otherwise try to pull it from the filename retrieved.
